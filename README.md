This project is a strong demonstration of my skills, particularly in C++, data structures, and algorithm implementation.<br/>
1. Demonstrates Knowledge of Core Data Structures:

Unordered Map: I have used an unordered map for quick lookups by ID.<br />

Binary Search Tree (BST): Implementing a BST to store books by title and demonstrating tree-based data structures and the ability to manage data with efficient search, insert, and delete operations.
<br/>


Linked List: Using a linked list to maintain the insertion order of books.
<br/>
<br />
3. File Handling and Persistence:
Use of file handling to save and load the library data ensures that the system can store data persistently, which is a key aspect of real-world applications.
<br/>


4. Object-Oriented Programming:
The code is well-structured using classes and structs, showcasing your understanding of object-oriented programming principles.
